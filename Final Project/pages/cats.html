        <h2>Buttercup</h2>
        Buttercup is a kitten that was rescued from the side of a road. We saw him while we driving down a road, took him in, and
        I had a Peanut Butter Cup in my back pocket, he was attractd to it. I gave it to him, and he loved it! He got chocolate,
        everywhere! This is the story of why we, at Cat Cafe, call this cat Buttercup.

        <h2>Cookie</h2>
        This is Cookie. Cookie was rescued from an empty swimming pool. The swimming pool was 6 feet deep, and completely empty.
        There was also a drounght in the area at the time. Cookie was stuck in the pool for approximately 3 days! He had
        no food, or water during that time. Whenever we found him, we immediately gave him a pack of cookies and a some water.
        He devoured that pack of cookies, and that is why we call him Cookie

        <h2>Snowball</h2>
        This is Snowball. Snowball was found buried under alot of snow, the only sign that he was there, were his two pointed ears.
        When we picked him up, He looked like snow, and he was freezing. So we brought him inside and warmed him up. We call
        him snowball because whenever we picked him up, he looked like a huge snowball! Since then, we have called him Snowball.

        <H2>Daisy</H2>
        This is Daisy. Daisy was rescued from the middle of a huge corn field. The cat did get some water during this time. We call
        her Daisy because she loves the outdoors. The reason she got stuck in a corn field is because she was in a house,
        but she wanted to go outside in the sun. She then escaped the house to go into the corn field, then got lost. We
        asked the original owner if they would like her back, they refused. They said they can visit her when they visit
        the Cat Cafe.
