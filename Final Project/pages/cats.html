        <h2>Buttercup</h2>
        <p class="catsp">Buttercup is a kitten that was rescued from the side of a road. We saw him while we driving down a road, took him
            in, and I had a Peanut Butter Cup in my back pocket, he was attractd to it. I gave it to him, and he loved it!
            He got chocolate, everywhere! This is the story of why we, at Cat Cafe, call this cat Buttercup.</p>

        <h2>Cookie</h2>
        <p class="catsp">This is Cookie. Cookie was rescued from an empty swimming pool. The swimming pool was 6 feet deep, and completely
            empty. There was also a drought in the area at the time. Cookie was stuck in the pool for approximately 3 days!
            He had no food, or water during that time. Whenever we found him, we immediately gave him a pack of cookies and
            a some water. He devoured that pack of cookies, and that is why we call him Cookie.</p>

        <h2>Snowball</h2>
        <p class="catsp">This is Snowball. Snowball was found buried under alot of snow, the only sign that he was there, were his two pointed
            ears. When we picked him up, He looked like snow, and he was freezing. So we brought him inside and warmed him
            up. We call him snowball because whenever we picked him up, he looked like a huge snowball! Since then, we have
            called him Snowball.</p>

        <H2>Daisy</H2>
        <p class="catsp">This is Daisy. Daisy was rescued from the middle of a huge corn field. The cat did get some water during this time.
            We call her Daisy because she loves the outdoors. The reason she got stuck in a corn field is because she was
            in a house, but she wanted to go outside in the sun. She then escaped the house to go into the corn field, then
            got lost. We asked the original owner if they would like her back, they refused. They said they can visit her
            when they visit the Cat Cafe.</p>

        <h2>Bubbles</h2>
        <p class="catsp">This is Bubbles. Bubbles was rescued from a pipe, which was full of trash, and the place where Bubbles was sleeping,
            was a large bubbles container. The bubbles container was empty, and so whenever we resuced him, we got him a
            huge bubble container, and had a tiny bubbles party! This is wh we call him Bubbles.</p>
